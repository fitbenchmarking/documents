Discussion items
----------------
* Andrew welcome to the project:)
* Need to move location for these weekly catchups (assume time is still OK?)
* Some parts of code could benefit from some (joint) maintenance work, which have gone out of sync in places
  * documentation of top level functions and parameters
  * some difficult to understand code
  * clearity of cost-function we exactly executing in all cases, with respect to weight
  * ...
  * Suggest: half-day-ish current and new testers and engineers 
* Items before Christmas
  * New starter maintenance
  * Larger task maintenance, e.g. can merge fit problem definition file types FitBenchmark and sasview?
  * Add representative set of Sasview problem definitions, and create short report of results from this
  * Start to look at comparison between different software and what may be missing before we really believe in such comparisons
