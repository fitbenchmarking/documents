Participants: 

Discussion items
----------------
* Atom update
* A policy on which data we accept, and agree on what the data error behavior is when no data is specified
* Discuss any work done towards https://github.com/fitbenchmarking/fitbenchmarking/issues/182
* Next two Fridays and Michael volunteered to cover as the on-site go-to person


Suggestion for a policy on data referenced in problem definition files
----------------------------------------------------------------------

All data files referenced in problem definition files most either 

 * Contain error values for all data point and where all the error values are larger than zero 
 * No error values for all data points. Then few options are availible
   * 5% of intensity, where if zero revert to 1
   * square-root of intensity, where if zero revert to 1
   * All error equal to 1 
  
This policity is enforced to add clarity to what FitBenchmarking benchmarking against. However, if it role out important problem it can be requested to be modified.


Points
------

* Table should show that policy has been broken and in addtional also messages in the console and in log file
* Table should show when a fit fail or converge across all minimizers
* Insist on PR approval before adding new model
